# Interactive-3D-Particle-Environment
This system is an interactive 3D particle visualization controlled by real-time hand gestures. A Python backend uses camera-based hand tracking to detect finger positions and pinches, streams gesture data via WebSockets, and drives a browser-based Three.js particle environment with shape, motion, and color controls.
